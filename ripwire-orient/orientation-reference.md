# Advanced orientation and recovery

Load the relevant mode for an unresolved map, documentation retrieval, authorized delegation, visualization/export, notes, or code-state recovery after actual context loss. Apply the task's authority first: `--situ` reads worktree changes and is unavailable in staged-only work; neither retrieval nor current source supersedes a protected user-selected target. Field-note writes, dumps, exports, new files, and delegation require task authority. An unchanged continuation does not restart this ladder.

## The escalation ladder — climb only until you feel oriented

**0. Recall what you already KNOW** — `ripwire <dir> --recall="<the task>"`
The most relevant DOCS' FULL bodies (docs only, so code never swamps them — markdown memory notes,
planning/design docs, skills, READMEs, plus `.ipynb`/`.html`/`.csv`/Office/PDF via the optional
markitdown bridge). Point it at the **memory dir** for what past sessions learned, or the **repo root** for
plans/designs — ~47× fewer tokens than loading everything. A design doc may already answer the question; if
so, stop here. It also works unmodified as a zero-setup knowledge base over a scratch dir of dumped tool
output (a git log, fetched docs, `--help` text) — not just a source repo. Two conditions are yours to meet
when you WRITE the dump: dump it as `.md` (`.txt`/`.log`/`.json` are not documents to `--recall`, and a dir
of them answers `0 relevant of 0 document files`), and keep `##` headings in it, so a deep answer is served
as a ranked section instead of waiting behind a front-first cut. Raising `--max-tokens` then grows what ONE
already-served document gets — that per-document guarantee is not global: dump several documents into one
dir and admitting another one re-divides the shared budget, which can shrink an already-served document's
own slice (`share_bytes=` in the header discloses it). Full form in
[`map-before-you-read.md`](map-before-you-read.md); the recorded run is `docs/COMMANDS.md`'s `--recall`
pattern subsection.

**1. Architecture summary** — `ripwire <dir> --report`
Plain markdown: file + symbol count, call-graph modules (Louvain clusters with lead symbol), god-files
ranked by `afferent` (dependents), cycle list, top PageRank symbols. **Read the god-file list carefully** —
highest-leverage, highest-risk files. For most "orient me" asks this one rung is enough.

**2. Task-relevant code** — `ripwire <dir> --for="<the task in your own words>"`
Ranked signatures + doc-comments + cx/in metrics by relevance (matches names, docs, AND bodies — not just
identifiers). This is the rung that answers "where's the code for X".
**What the bundle serves depends on which way the query routed, and the root says which.**
*Named a symbol* (`bundle="auto" bodies="N"`): the anchor's FULL body rides inline, CDATA plus callee
signatures — **read it here instead of opening the file the map named**, that follow-up read is the cost
this default deletes. `bodies="0" reason="budget"` means it did not fit whole.
*Conceptual phrase* (`bundle="compact" bodies="0" reason="compact-route"`): no bodies — you get the ranked
map plus a `<hops>` section, one row per top-ranked symbol with its one-hop callee names. **Read the map,
pick ONE symbol, then `--expand=path:name`** (paste the row's own `p=` and `n=`; a bare name that is not
unique costs you the whole map). That is the flow, and it is cheaper than the bodies were: half the bytes
of the old bundle on conceptual queries, and the edges tell you which symbol is worth the second call.
`--auto-bodies` restores inline bodies on that route if you want them; `--signatures-only` drops both
shapes; `--detail=N` picks the body count explicitly.
`--for` **auto-routes** (default, no flag needed): a query that *names a symbol* (`--for="buildGraph"`) gets
name-exact BM25 (recall@1 ~99% vs ~77% generic) — **know the name, query it verbatim**; a conceptual phrase
uses subtoken+body BM25 instead. The header prints which ranker fired; `--no-route` forces the plain ranker.
It also **anchors query mentions** by default — a file/module/`Type.method` literally named in the task text
gets lifted near the top (+4.9pp held-out; a task naming nothing indexed is byte-identical); disable with
`--no-mention-boost`. It also surfaces DOCS: a markdown design/plan doc that `backtick`-names one of the
query's top-resolved symbols is lifted into the bundle too (strictly below that symbol's own score) — the
doc explains it even when its own prose shares no words with your query; disable with `--no-doc-mention`.
`--adaptive` cuts the result at the relevance cliff instead of a fixed top-k. Same
routing in the MCP `for` verb. Orienting from a pasted issue/bug-report's own text? `--anchor` beats plain
`--for` on Loc-Bench (n=560) — a mild win, not a default (`bench/locbench/README.md`). `--cochange-boost` is
an experimental, off-by-default co-change prior — see `ripwire --help` before reaching for it.

**3. File-by-file map** — `ripwire <dir> --tree` — each file with its top symbols, a quick "what's where".

**4. Cohesive modules** — `ripwire <dir> --communities` — `<communities modules="N">`, each cluster with its
dominant directory and lead symbols; `<bridge>` edges show tight coupling between clusters. Use it to decide
where a new feature belongs. Each row shows only its top five members — to see one module in full,
`ripwire <dir> --community=ID` (the `id=` from a row, or from `--zoom`): its complete ranked member list
(`--limit`/`--offset` page it) plus every bridge edge that module has. That is the call to make when a
cluster looks like the one you'll be working in and five names aren't enough to judge it.

**5. Maintenance pain** — `ripwire <dir> --hotspots` — files ranked by `score = churn × ccx`; `top=` names
the gnarliest function. Plan edits around this list.

**6. Budget it** if the map is large — `--max-tokens=8000` or `--top-k=50`.

## Orienting N agents at once, not yourself — `--partition=N`

About to fan a single task out to several parallel agents? Do **not** let each one run its own
`--pack-task` — they will each re-derive the same top symbols, the same bodies, the same tests, and you
pay for the map N times. Run it **once**:

```bash
ripwire <dir> --pack-task="<the task in words>" --partition=4
```

You get one `<ctx-partitions>` document: a **shared common core** (the anchors the task is literally about,
what every agent needs) plus **N per-agent slices** carved along the call graph's own Louvain communities,
so a slice is a union of whole modules rather than an arbitrary rank cut (symbols the call graph is silent
about — edgeless data types — group by *file* instead, so one header's structs stay together). Each `<bundle>` wraps a complete,
standalone bundle — hand one bundle to one agent verbatim. `--token-budget` here means **one agent's**
budget (core + its slice), not the document's; `--json` gives the same plan machine-readably. MCP: the same
thing as a `partition` argument on the `explore` verb.

**Read the wrapper attributes before you trust the split** — the verb reports its own quality:
`overlap_max` (worst pairwise Jaccard between slices; low = the agents really are reading different code),
`split="K"` (K>0 means there were fewer modules than agents, so a module was cut at its rank median — the
slices are less semantically clean), `partitions` < `requested` (the task's surface could not supply N
separable slices at all — take fewer agents), and `core_overlap` (how much of the core a slice reaches
anyway). On a task whose whole surface sits inside one module, a partition is a rank cut, not a module
boundary — one `--pack-task` and one agent is the honest answer there.

## When a flat module list is too coarse (big repos) — zoom out

**7. Nested module hierarchy** — `ripwire <dir> --zoom` (`--zoom=DEPTH` to cap levels; the default prints the top 2
levels of the 40 largest modules — `levels_shown=`/`shown=` disclose it, `next=` pastes the next page, `--zoom-levels=0`
prints every level): multi-level Louvain,
`<module level=N id= size= dir=>`, indent = one level deeper, innermost `level="0"` lists top-ranked members.
Read top-down; a `dir=` that doesn't match its parent's is a cross-cutting concern in the wrong place.
Trailing `<bridge …>` entries name the high-traffic integration seams *between* top modules — pair with
`--seams` to see which ones no test reaches.

**8. Render it** — `ripwire <dir> --zoom --mermaid` (or `--mermaid` for the flat module graph): a
`flowchart TB`, paste at mermaid.live. For hand-exploring, `ripwire <dir> --html[=FILE]` writes a
self-contained clickable wiki (module cards → subgraphs → Sourcetrail-style node recentering, no CDN);
`--color-by=community|cx|churn|tested` sets its initial node-colour lens (a live selector covers the rest).
Working inside a `--for`/`--pack-task` bundle instead of a whole-repo pass? Add `--with-graph` to that
same call — it appends a tiny `<graph fmt="mermaid">` block (top-8 ranked anchors + their 1-hop call
edges) right in the bundle, no second call.

**9. Export it** — `ripwire <dir> --export=cc.json[:FILE]` — per-file metrics (loc, cx, fan-in/out, churn) as
a CodeCharta `cc.json` for its 3D city view; the ladder's visualization end-point, not a map to read.

## Then read, and trust the honesty signals

**Read the specific files ripwire surfaces** (god-files + hotspots first) — don't grep blindly. A symbol's
`amb="K"` means K of its calls are ambiguous (the resolver guessed) → read the source if which-target
matters. A map header showing `skipped_oversize=N` means N otherwise-indexable files were dropped for
exceeding a size ceiling — they are absent from `files=` and every ranking; `ripwire <dir> --skipped`
names them (path + bytes + the ceiling that dropped each), so you know what the index cannot show you
before you trust a "not found". A git root also drops every `.gitignore`d path by default (header `ignored_files=N`, absent when 0; `--skipped` lists them); `ripwire <dir> --no-ignore` restores the full walk when the symbol you want lives in an ignored tree. Caveat: *broad, common-word* questions can still favor plain `rg` —
ripwire shines on specific technical asks. CI-enforceable module boundaries graduate to
`--arch=rules.txt` (see **ripwire-layers**).

## Leave a note for next time — the gotcha you just learned (field notes)

The most expensive thing you rebuild across sessions is **gotchas, not structure**. When you learn a
non-obvious fact about a symbol or file (a race trap, an off-by-one seam, "don't touch this without
re-running X"), pin it so the *next* orientation surfaces it automatically:

```bash
ripwire . --note-add="Bar::compute: recompute is NOT idempotent — reset the arena first"
ripwire . --note-add="src/pool.h: 128-byte cache line on Apple, never hardcode 64"   # a file also works
```

The TARGET is **a symbol name or a path**. A symbol resolves through the same resolver the read verbs use,
so every spelling they accept works here — a bare name, `file:name`, `Scope::name`, the canonical id
`path::scope::name`, `@FILE:LINE` — and is **canonicalised to the canonical id on write** (that is the id
notes are keyed by; the rewrite is echoed on stderr). A name matching several definitions is refused, naming
each; a name matching none is refused with a did-you-mean. A path is written even when nothing indexed
matches it yet — a note on a file you are about to add is legal — with a loud warning that it is dangling.
Notes live in committed `.ripwire_notes` and **surface on their own** — whenever `--for`/`--expand` emit that
symbol/file, the note rides along as a `<note d="date">…</note>` child. `ripwire . --notes` lists every note
(`dangling="1"` = target no longer in the tree). `--recall=TASK` is the doc-level complement.
`--note-add` nudges (stderr, non-blocking) toward writing the decision, not a description — a note that
keeps firing on the same symbol has outgrown a comment: graduate it into a `--quality-ack` reason or a
standing `--arch` deny rule.

## Resuming — a compaction, or a new session on work already in flight

A different moment from a cold start: you are **not** cold on the repo, you are cold on **your own last
hour**. The task is known; what evaporated is the reasoning, the gotchas already paid for, and what you had
half-changed. Re-reading source rebuilds the *least* valuable of those. Run the three verbs that rebuild the
rest, in this order:

```bash
ripwire . --recall="<the task, in the words you'd use>"   # 1. what past sessions WROTE DOWN
ripwire . --situ                                          # 2. what the working tree already CHANGED
ripwire . --notes                                         # 3. gotchas already paid for
```

1. **`--recall`** returns the *full bodies* of the most relevant markdown only — memory notes,
   planning/design docs, READMEs — so code can't swamp them. This is the decisions-and-rationale layer that a
   compaction destroys and that source code never contained in the first place. Point it at your memory dir
   for past-session memory, or the repo root for the project's plans.
2. **`--situ`** (defaults to `git diff`) tells you what you had already changed, its blast radius, the tests
   to run, and the co-change partners you hadn't touched yet — i.e. where you actually stopped, and what you
   were about to break. This is the step that most often reveals work-in-flight you would otherwise redo.
3. **`--notes`** lists every pinned gotcha (`dangling="1"` = its target is gone). Anything relevant will also
   re-surface on its own once `--for`/`--expand` emit that symbol — see the section above.

Then, and only then, escalate the ladder for whatever is still missing. Two honest cautions: `--recall`
returns what the docs **claim**, not what is still true — a stale plan doc reads exactly as confidently as a
current one, so trust `--situ`'s working-tree facts over a doc when they disagree. And `--situ` carries **no
`at=` commit stamp**, so if you are resuming across a rebase or a moved HEAD, record `git rev-parse --short
HEAD` yourself before you quote anything from it.

**Before the next compaction, spend the note.** The compaction you are recovering from is the argument for
`--note-add`: a gotcha written to `.ripwire_notes` survives a context reset; one held only in context does
not. When you are deep in a task and learn something non-obvious, pin it *then* — not at the end.
